# lua-todo
`lua-todo` is a classic todo application made in Lua.

## Background
I wanted to get a better understanding of Lua and it's syntax. So I created a console application that has a simple CRUD functionallity, that can save/load from a text file. 

## What I want to do next
- Adding unit tests with [Busted](https://olivinelabs.com/busted/)
- Adding installation instructions with the help of the .rockspec
- Getting better understanding of .rockspec
- Replacing file I/O to a cloud based database (probably Firebase)
